A TypeScript library that implements the File Store Emulator connector. It provides easy access to a curated set of files for demonstration and evaluation purposes.

## Rust WebAssembly Helpers

The connector now ships with a lightweight Rust crate located in [rust/dpuse-connector-file-store-emulator-core](rust/dpuse-connector-file-store-emulator-core). It is compiled to WebAssembly with `wasm-pack` so TypeScript can call native Rust logic.

- Run `npm run build:rust` (requires the [`wasm-pack` CLI](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)) whenever you change the Rust sources. The command rebuilds the package into [rust/dpuse-connector-file-store-emulator-core/pkg](rust/dpuse-connector-file-store-emulator-core/pkg).
- The async wrapper in [src/rustBridge.ts](src/rustBridge.ts) lazy-loads the generated bindings and surfaces helpers like `addNumbersWithRust()` and `checksumWithRust()`.
- `FileStoreEmulatorConnector` exposes `addUsingRust()` and `versionChecksumUsingRust()` so consumers can exercise the Rust-backed functionality without dealing with low-level WebAssembly plumbing.

## Installation

There’s no need to install this connector manually. Once released, it’s uploaded to the Data Positioning Engine cloud and becomes instantly available to all new instances of the browser app. A notification about the new version is also sent to all existing browser apps.

## Reports & Compliance

### Dependency Check Report

The OWASP Dependency Check Report identifies known vulnerabilities in project dependencies. It is generated automatically on each release using the npm package `owasp-dependency-check`. We also rely on GitHub Dependabot to continuously check for vulnerabilities across all dependencies.

### Dependency Licenses

The following table lists top-level production and peer dependencies. All these dependencies (including transitive ones) have been recursively verified to use Apache-2.0, CC0-1.0, or MIT—commercially friendly licenses with minimal restrictions. Developers cloning this repository should independently verify dev and optional dependencies; users of the uploaded library are covered by these checks.
